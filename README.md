**MineSweeper**

Small mine sweeper game. Can you find all the mines without exploding?

To start the game, run the MineSweeper.jar file.

*Controls*
1. You can choose the size of the minefield and how many mines should be deployed.
2. Left-click to uncover a field.
3. Right-click to mark a field as suspect, after that you cannot accidentally click on it again, unless you unmark it with another right-click.

When you uncover a field, you will see a number, which shows how many mines are in the proximity of the field.
Good luck!
